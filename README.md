# CAD-webauto
Websites for displaying 3d models in an automated fashion with Node, Threejs, and python.

Stuff to add:
-Change js,html,css to follow folder-flow naming and data pulling
-include routing to follow folder-flow naming and data pulling
-python automation:
	-git clone/pull requests ->/gitclone/
	-conversion and generation of stl data: glbarrangement.json, file1.glb, file2.glb, file2.glb
	-can I do periodic regular script running on Ubuntu?

-setupscript/bash/(npm package?)


Current setup method:
:terminal:
```
$ npm isntall vite@latest

$ npm init vite@latest
	->name_project

	->vanilla
		->vanilla
$ cd name_project
/name_project/$ npm install
/name_project/$ npm run dev
```
then copy/replace the files generated by vite with everything in the code section of this repo.
-sooner or later I should lean how npm install works to simplify this a bit.
